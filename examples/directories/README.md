# Directories Example

This directory contains an example that demonstrates a functions organized in directories and a simple table being synced.

- Running `ksd sync tables --endpoint <endpount>` syncs the simple table.
- Running `ksd sync functions --endpoint <endpount>` syncs the functions. `dir1` and `dir2` are created in Azure Data Explorer, with the functions organized accordingly based on the directory structure.
